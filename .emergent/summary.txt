The AI engineer successfully initiated the Studio Features implementation, focusing on the frontend as per instructions. The primary task involved developing the Study Kit Generator (quizzes, flashcards, study planner, theory questions) using specific open-source ML models. The engineer's approach involved setting up an  utility for model loading and inference, and integrating this into . This process revealed critical issues: 404s for model weights, WASM memory allocation failures, a PWA manifest icon error, and a React component definition bug. The engineer diligently debugged and applied targeted fixes, including switching to web-optimized model mirrors, implementing memory management strategies, generating correct PWA icons, and restoring missing component definitions. While core functionality for the Study Kit is claimed to be established, several console warnings persist, indicating areas for further refinement. The work has progressed iteratively with continuous user feedback and bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
The core objective is to build Studio Features for an educational application, strictly as a frontend-only implementation, without any backend or database. Speed and accuracy are non-negotiable, leveraging specified open-source ML/AI models and libraries.

The features required are:
1.  **Study Kit Generator**:
    *   **Quiz Questions (10)**: Generate from PDF/text, excluding headings/author info. Questions and options must be unique, varied in difficulty, grammatically correct, with filler options similar to correct ones. Evaluation should show correctness and a concise explanation.
    *   **Flashcards**: Extract concise, non-vague/generic topics from content for revision.
    *   **7 Day Study Planner**: Generate a detailed, non-vague/generic 7-day plan from the content.
    *   **Theory Questions**: Generate long-answer questions from the content.
2.  **AI Summariser**: Summarize PDF/text content based on selected length (Short/Medium/Long). Output must be pointwise, exclude irrelevant text (headings, gibberish, author).
3.  **Resume Builder**: Provide a professional, minimal live preview that updates automatically as fields are edited. PDF export is a future consideration.

The existing UI style must be preserved, and prior logic for these features should be overwritten.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend ML/AI**: Running models entirely in the browser using , , .
-   **Specific ML Models**:  (summarization, QG),  (embeddings),  (resume auto-suggestions, pending).
-   **PDF Handling**: Utilizing  for text extraction.
-   **Text Processing**: Employing  for cleaning.
-   **PWA Standards**: Correctly configuring  for web app icons.
-   **Error Recovery**: Implementing fallbacks (e.g., TF.js for embeddings) and memory management.

<code_architecture>
The application structure is a standard full-stack setup, but current feature development is focused entirely on the  directory.



*   :
    *   **Importance**: This new file centralizes the logic for loading and running machine learning models in the browser using . It contains functions for ,  (Question Generation), and  pipelines, which are crucial for the Study Kit features. It also includes error handling with fallbacks (e.g., to TensorFlow.js for embeddings) and memory optimization techniques.
    *   **Changes Made**: This file was initially created to host the AI logic. It has been updated multiple times to:
        *   Point to  for embeddings instead of  to resolve 404 errors.
        *   Default to  for Question Generation after  caused 404s.
        *   Implement sentence truncation (512 chars), total sentence capping (160), and batching (16) to prevent  memory errors during embedding, ensuring smoother performance on larger inputs.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Serves as the main React application component. It defines the application's routes and integrates the various Studio Features functionality by calling functions from . It also manages the UI state related to input (text/PDF), generated content, and user interactions within the Study Kit.
    *   **Changes Made**: Substantially modified to:
        *   Integrate the  and other AI-powered functions from .
        *   Display generated quizzes, flashcards, study plans, and theory questions.
        *   Handle user quiz selections and evaluation logic, showing correct/wrong answers with explanations.
        *   Show basic PDF file details (name, size, page count) upon upload.
        *   Critically, the  component definition was restored to resolve a  that was crashing the app.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: This file provides metadata for the Progressive Web App (PWA), including app icons for various device sizes. Incorrect configuration can lead to PWA warnings or broken icon displays.
    *   **Changes Made**: Updated to correctly specify PWA icons. Initially, the icon declarations were causing browser warnings due to potential size mismatches. It was revised to explicitly define  and  entries pointing to newly generated icons.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: This new build script (a modern JS module) uses the  library to automatically generate correctly sized PWA icons (, ) from a single source logo provided by the user. This automation ensures PWA compliance and consistent icon quality.
    *   **Changes Made**: This file was newly created and integrated into the  script to ensure icon generation happens automatically after dependency installation.

<current_work>
The immediate past work focused on stabilizing and fixing critical bugs within the **Study Kit Generator** features after their initial implementation. The Study Kit (Quiz, Flashcards, 7-Day Plan, Theory Questions) is functionally implemented to run entirely on the frontend using specified ML models.

Specifically:
-   **Model Loading & Stability**:
    -   The  model for embeddings now loads correctly by using its ONNX web mirror, , resolving previous 404 errors. A fallback to TF.js Universal Sentence Encoder is in place for resilience.
    -   The  model for question generation was causing 404s. As per the user's explicit instruction, the system now defaults to  for QG.
    -   Memory issues () during embedding large texts have been mitigated by implementing client-side data handling: sentences are truncated to 512 characters, a maximum of 160 sentences are processed, and processing occurs in batches of 16.
-   **PWA Icon Fix**: The Progressive Web App (PWA) icon display issues, which caused console errors and warnings, have been addressed. A new script () was created to generate  and  PNG icons from the provided logo, and  was updated to correctly reference these generated assets, hooked into .
-   **Application Crash Fix**: A critical  error, which prevented the application from loading, was resolved by restoring the missing  component definition in .
-   **PDF Upload Feedback**: Upon PDF upload, the UI now provides immediate confirmation by displaying the file name, size, and page count, addressing user feedback about not seeing their uploaded PDF. A visual preview is pending.

While core functionality of the Study Kit Generator is believed to be operational with the required models, the console still displays numerous non-critical warnings related to ONNX Runtime's graph optimization (), a deprecated parameter in , and an undefined function warning in .
